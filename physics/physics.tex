From Jackson \cite{jackson1999classical}: 



\section{Figures}
To include images, you can put them anywhere in the folder structure, but you have to give an absolute path relative to the base folder.  For instance, in the folder \verb|figures|, there is a picture called \verb|LIGO.png|.  However, to include this image, I must use \verb|../physics/figures/LIGO.png| i.e. I have to go up to the main folder then back down.  This is so the main file will know where this image is.
